    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Now, you're probably wondering why Ann Pham is a Software Developer "In-Training."
      And long-story short, I work as a technologist in a field where a lot of the new automation processes are being introduced. As I validated some of 
      these new machines for everyday laboratory use, there were a lot of correspondence with tech support trying to solve issues with failed trail runs. 
      Most people may have headaches being on the phone with IT, but I for one, enjoyed seeing what goes behind the scenes for these machines to work.
      Which brings me to today, as I take this NCSU course in Software Development to hopefully, one day, program for new life changing technology.
